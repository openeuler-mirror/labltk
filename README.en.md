It allows to develop GUI applications in a speedy and type safe way.
It was derived from the CamlTk project, and a legacy CamlTk API is included. 
The OCamlBrowser library viewer is also part ofthis project.

LablTk provides a strongly-typed, yet comfortable, interface to Tcl/Tk's widgets through OCaml's rich type system. 
Most widgets and methods are available, along with many examples.

The toplevel can be used for interactive development.
